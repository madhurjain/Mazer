This was a Micromouse (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromouse) simulator i was working on 
along with my buddy intelomkar. I built a custom user control called the Maze Tile to be 
used in the Maze. intelomkar was responsible for implementing the shortest path algo (A*, Flood fill) 
which he didn't :P
